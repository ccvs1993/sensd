1)
/etc/SIDS (Sensors ID'S) something like  /etc/hosts
to get human readable information.


ID=28be51ce02000031 apple-tree
E64=XXXXXXXXXXXXXXX ups

2)
SIDS in DNS system.


3)
Net synchronizing of two or more sensd. To avoid bogus reports etc


4)
Have sensd to cache last report from a sensor with a time-stamp.
Should be able to read out from server.
