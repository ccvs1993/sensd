                 Getting and building the sensd package
                 -------------------------------------.

The preferred way is to use git via github.com. Build follows standard
Unix make build process.

# First:
git clone https://github.com/herjulf/sensd

#To sync 
cd sensd; git pull

cd sensd

make

cp sensd/sensd /sbin
cp seltag/seltag /sbin
 
# When having connected the sensor node, you check with dmesg in which 
# serial port it ended up in ended up.

# Assuming it is in ttyUSB0, and you do not want to save the printouts, 
# You can start the sensd daemon using the example below:

/sbin/sensd -cmd -f/dev/null -report /dev/ttyUSB0

#  -f/dev/null [default -f/var/log/sensors.dat ]
#  -cmd        Allow remote commands. Consider security issues.
#  -report     Enable sensor reports over the Internet. 

# But chose the command options for your WSN setup. 
# For options, usage and version etc.

sensd -h
